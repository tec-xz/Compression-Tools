# Compression-Tools
To Compress and extract the files in the linux 


* Gzip

Gzip is certainly one of the most widely used compression tools for Linux admins. It is compatible with every GNU software, making it the perfect compression tool for remote engineers. Gzip leverages the Lempel-Ziv coding in deflate mode for file compression. It can reduce the size of source codes by up to 90 percent. Overall, this is an excellent choice for seasoned Linux users as well as software developers.






*bzip2

bzip2, a free compression tool for Linux, compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting compression algorithm and Huffman coding. It also supports several additional compression methods, such as run-length encoding, delta encoding, sparse bit array, and Huffman tables. It can also recover data from media drives in some cases. Overall, bzip2 is a suitable compression tool for everyday usage due to its robust compression abilities and fast decompression speed.




 *XZ 

XZ Utils is a suite of compression tools for Linux that can compress and decompress .xz and .lzma files. It primarily uses the LZMA2 algorithm for compression and can perform integrity checks of compressed data at ease. Since this tool is available to popular Linux distributions by default, it can be a viable choice for compression in many situations.
